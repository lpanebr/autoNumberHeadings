## Features
**Current functionalities are:**

- Menu and Addon UIs.
- Add Headings Numbers
- Remove Heading Numbers
- Promote Headings (H1âž™Title ... H6âž™H5)
- Demote Headings (Titleâž™Title, H1âž™H2 ... H6âž™Normal)
- Output processed Headings as text only
- Add/Remove and Promote/Demote only some heading levels (1-6)

## How to use
After you [install the script](#how-to-install), the easiest way to Add/Remove is through the **Lord of The Rings shortcut** `Alt+/` that opens the Help menu with the cursor focused on the find shortcut field. From there you just need to type `head` to get the basic features:

Or you can use mouse:

Or you can use the Addon sidebar, which also lets you access the 'interactive' version and outputs the plain text headings:

## How to install

Note: You'll only need the files `autonumber.gs` and `sidebar.html`. The `code.gs` is here only for historic reasons.

1. Open your document
2. Extensions > Apps Script
3. Give the project a name and save (this name is how it will appear on the Addons submenu)
4. Paste the code from the `autonumber.gs` file over whatever code your file has
5. Click the âž• sign and create a HTML file named `sidebar`
6. Paste the code from the `sidebar.html` file over the default file content
7. Change back to the `autonumber.gs` file 
8. Click on the **Run** button on the menu bar to execute the **onOpen** function and authorize the script for the first time
9. Change to your Document and reload it.

If all went well you'll see a **Heading Tools** menu and also the entry in the **Extensions** menu.
