## How to use

ðŸ’¡ The easiest way to use it is through the **Lord of The Rings shortcut** `Alt+/` that opens the Help menu with the cursor focused on the find shortcut field.

From there you just need to type `head` to get the basic features:

## How to install

Note: You'll only need the files `autonumber.gs` and `sidebar.html`. The `code.gs` is here only for historic reasons.

1. Open your document
2. Extensions > Apps Script
3. Give the project a name and save (this name is how it will appear on the Addons submenu)
4. Paste the code from the `autonumber.gs` file over whatever code your file has
5. Click the âž• sign and create a HTML file named `sidebar`
6. Paste the code from the `sidebar.html` file over the default file content
7. Change back to the `autonumber.gs` file
8. Click on the **Run** button on the menu bar to execute the **onOpen** function and authorize the script for the first time
9. Change to your Document and reload it.

If all went well you'll see a **Heading Tools** menu and also the entry in the **Extensions** menu.
